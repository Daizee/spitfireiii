Need to "fix" amf3object:

amf3object obj = amf3object();
obj["data"] = amf3object();
amf3object & data = obj["data"];

obj["anything"] = "a";

causes data to no longer properly reference obj["data"].
Haven't followed the code to effectively figure out why.
What this does show is that the shared_ptr system needs
modification. The objects copy on assignment instead of
share like intended.

amf3object obj = amf3object();
amf3object obj2 = amf3object();
obj["cmd"] = "1";
obj2["cmd"] = "2";

obj = obj2;

obj != obj2 now. obj is a copy of obj2 and any changes to one
does not affect the other. The objects should be shared and
be references to each other internally with shared_ptrs with
obj having the "original" object.
